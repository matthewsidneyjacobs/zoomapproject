Welcome to the zoo map app made. Here in the readme I plan on keeping a mini-journal of sorts to better show the process of making an app with no server.

I will put brief progress reports here, along with issues I faced and how(if) I was able to overcome them. At time of writing (late nov 2016) I have about a week to finish this project, but I may come back to it in the future to implement and fix and improve things.
